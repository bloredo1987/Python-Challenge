# Python-Challenge

The PyBank/PyPoll folders contain code that is performing an analysis on the election_data and budget_data stored as CSV files.

Each python code imports the required modules 'os and 'csv' to handle file operations and CSV data. I then set the file path for the input CSV files using 'os.path.join()' function. I then initialize the variables needed for the following analysis.

The PyPoll calculates the total votes and vote count for each candidate, prints the results to the console, and exports the results to a text file for further analysis or reporting.

The PyBank calculates the total votes and vote count for each candidate, prints the results to the console, and exports the results to a text file for further analysis or reporting.
